![GitHub release (latest SemVer including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/newrelic/nr1-apdex-optimizer?include_prereleases&sort=semver) [![Snyk](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-apdex-optimizer/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/newrelic/nr1-apdex-optimizer)

## Usage

New Relic customers often ask what they should set their Apdex Thresholds to. This observability application (nerdpack) provides actionable recommendations based on existing best practice, and provides links to the relevant page to make the suggested changes.

If you have an app that has been running for a while in a steady state and you feel you have a good baseline for acceptable performance, you can start by setting your Apdex threshold to give you a baseline Apdex score of 0.95. So youâ€™ll want to get the 90th percentile value and set that to Apdex T.

The suggested thresholds above are based on the 90th percentile. It is recommended that the time picker is set to 7 days.
 
This follows great advice provided by Bill Kayser on the New Relic company [blog](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/how-to-choose-apdex-t/).

Once selected, each APM and Browser application for the account is listed in a table. For each application the currently configured Apdex Thresholds are presented, along with links to the application settings page where changes to the Apdex Threshold (ApdexT) can be made. Suggested APM and Browser Apdex Thresholds are provided and are updated based upon the time picker period.

In the case of deploying to a master account, a drop down allows each sub-account to be selected. If deployed to a single sub-account, the account is automatically selected.

The application relies upon a combination of native NerdGraph and NRQL-based queries. It consists of two top-level React components, the first to identify and list the user's available accounts, and the second to render the table. Based upon a third-party open source React library, react-table, the table can be sorted on every column, provides pagination and allow relevant cells to be filtered based on a search term. Throughput and errors have been added to allow users to use those values for prioritization.

# If you need to create a new uuid for the account to which you're deploying this Nerdpack, use the following
# nr1 nerdpack:uuid -g [--profile=your_profile_name]
# to see a list of APIkeys / profiles available in your development environment, run nr1 credentials:list
nr1 nerdpack:publish [--profile=your_profile_name]
nr1 nerdpack:deploy [-c [DEV|BETA|STABLE]] [--profile=your_profile_name]
nr1 nerdpack:subscribe [-c [DEV|BETA|STABLE]] [--profile=your_profile_name]
